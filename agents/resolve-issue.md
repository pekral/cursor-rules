For the given URL addresses of issues, run @.cursor/skills/auto-fix-bug/SKILL.md (if the issue is closed or not ready for processing, do nothing!) and after writing the code, run @.cursor/skills/class-refactoring/SKILL.md for all new PHP classes, fix DRY, apply solid, and apply SRP! Then run the fixes if available (composer scripts, phing, etc.) and then 
 run @.cursor/skills/code-review/SKILL.md if all critical issues are resolved, and repeat from step 1.

Always verify functionality according to the assignment, and if everything is OK and some files have been changed, create a PR according to the defined rules every time! All messages must be in english!
