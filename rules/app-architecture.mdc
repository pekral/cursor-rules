## Repositories
- Only for read-only access
- No business rules.
- Disallow writes (`create`, `update`, `delete`, `save`, `attach`, `sync`, `increment`, `decrement`, `restore`, `forceDelete` etc.).

## Services
- Business logic will always be encapsulated in the service.
- Return DTOs or models.

## Data builders
- Prepare or transform domain data for persistence.
- Prepare a DTO objects if a more complex structure must be returned
- Assemble DTOs (e.g., adding defaults, enriching values).
- Never query DB directly.

## Controllers
- Delegate business logic to services only, logic in controllers is only for presentation and slim.
- Must always be named **plural** (e.g., `ContactsController`, `DomainsController`)
- Only accept **FormRequest** objects from the feature’s `Requests/` folder. Method injection is allowed.
- Never call `validate()` inside the controller.
- Must import only Services
- Command controllers are single-purpose and should expose **one verb-y endpoint**, typically `store` (POST) for the command, delegating to Service

## HTTP Requests
- Each controller method must have a dedicated **FormRequest** class.
- Handles validation & authorization.

## Model Managers
- Never read from database directly.
- Just only for store data into database.

## DTO
- Extends Spatie\LaravelData\Data::class if this class is available
