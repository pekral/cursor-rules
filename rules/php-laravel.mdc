## Layer Responsibilities
- **Controllers**: Slim, delegate to Services, accept FormRequest only
- **Services**: All business logic, return DTOs or models
- **Repositories**: Read-only, no writes, no business rules
- **ModelManagers**: Write-only, store data to DB
- **Data Builders**: Transform/prepare DTOs, never query DB
- **Jobs**: Slim, delegate to Services
- **Events**: Slim, delegate to Services
- **Commands**: Slim, delegate to Services

## Controllers
- Inject services by method injection
- Plural names (ContactsController)
- CRUD methods only (index, create, store, show, edit, update, destroy)
- Extract new controller for non-CRUD actions
- Never call `validate()` inside controller
- Implement proper request validation using Form Requests
- Aim for "slim" Controllers and put larger logic pieces in Service classes
- Ensure that every route checks permissions (e.g., auth/can middleware). Every CRUD action validates input.

## Database / Schema
- Primary keys on every table; prefer INT over BIGINT unless > ~2B rows
- Smallest fitting data types: INT for integers, DECIMAL for money, VARCHAR(n) for short strings, TIMESTAMP over DATETIME where possible
- Use InnoDB (row-level locking, foreign keys, transactions)
- Naming: lower_case_snake_case for tables and columns
- Normalize first; denormalize only when metrics show a read bottleneck
- Partition large tables by range (e.g. date) when query patterns benefit
- Prefer to use Eloquent over using Query Builder and raw SQL queries. Prefer collections over arrays
- Do not execute queries in Blade templates and use eager loading (N + 1 problem)

## Migrations
- Only `up()` methods, no `down()`
- When adding columns in a migration, update the model's `$fillable` array to include those new attributes
- Never chain multiple migration-creating commands (e.g., `make:model -m`, `make:migration`) with `&&` or `;` — they may get identical timestamps; run each command separately and wait for completion before running the next

## Blade / Views
- Analyze existing UI style before creating new
- Keep consistent layout, colors, typography
- Human-friendly, simply understandable
- Blade: 4-space indent, no space after control structures

## Testing
- Laravel: prefer Http::fake() over Mockery
- Always call jobs in tests using ::dispatch(), e.g., MyJob::dispatch()
- Always call console commands using Artisan::call(MyCommand::class)
- Mocking services is only allowed for classes that use external service calls or if it is necessary to simulate an exception throw.

## Helpers
- Use Laravel helpers instead of `use` section classes. Examples: use `auth()->id()` instead of `Auth::id()` and adding `Auth` in the `use` section. Other examples: use `redirect()->route()` instead of `Redirect::route()`, or `str()->slug()` instead of `Str::slug()`.
- Replace all foreach with collect() helper.

## Best practices
- Follow Laravel best practices and conventions
- Use object-oriented programming with a focus on SOLID principles
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication
- Favor dependency injection and service containers
- Use Eloquent ORM instead of raw SQL queries when possible
- Implement Repository pattern for data access layer
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features
- Utilize Laravel's caching mechanisms for improved performance
- Implement job queues for long-running tasks
- Use Laravel's built-in testing tools (Pest) for unit and feature tests
- Implement proper database indexing for improved query performance
- Use Laravel's built-in pagination features
- Implement proper error logging and monitoring
- Use Laravel's routing system for defining application endpoints

## Dependencies
- Composer for dependency management

## Livewire
- In Livewire projects, don't use Livewire Volt. Only Livewire class components.
